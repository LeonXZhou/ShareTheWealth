# ShareTheWealth

## Description

When we consider inclusion and diversity, we often gravitate towards divisions amoungst race, gender, and sexuality. We often don't think about one of the greatest divides amongst us, wealth inequality. ShareTheWealth is an event-planning app that aims to minimize this divide.

ShareTheWealth allows a group to anonymously and inclusively consider the available financial resources for any event. An organizer is able to construct a list of activities at different levels of cost and invite their potential attendees to anonymously indicate how much they can spend for each activity. The goal is to be considerate to those that may not be able to afford certain activities and to allow those who might be willing to pay more for a certain event to occur to potentially cover a portion of someone else. The organizer is able to see the total amount the attendees are willing to pay and can then decide what is possible for the group budget. Then, each attendee pays what they said they could, some may pay more, while some less.

We believe this app to be helpful and applicable in many situations such as for school events like field trips, work events like an annual office party, and even recreational events like a friday night out. Our eventual goal is that through use of this app people become more aware of wealth inequality and are encouraged to take other's financial capacities into consideration in the future.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
